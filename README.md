# Code of Conduct

The Netherlands eScience Center is dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free community for everyone.
We do not tolerate harassment or bullying of any community member in any form. This does not only extend to
employees of the Center, but to anyone who chooses to become involved in the larger community of users, developers
and integrators through events or interactions. Harassment includes offensive verbal/electronic comments related
to personal characteristics or choices, sexual images or comments in public or online spaces, deliberate
intimidation, bullying, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks,
chats, github communication, electronic meetings, physical meetings or other events, inappropriate physical contact,
or unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing or bullying behaviour are expected to comply
immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, representatives of the community may take reasonable
action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from any eScience Center events, or
expulsion from mailing lists, chats, discussion boards and other electronic communications channels to resolve the
issue. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please act
to intercede or ask for help from the organisers/representatives of any physical events put on under the auspices
of the Netherlands eScience Center.
